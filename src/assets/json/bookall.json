Her novel with the same title was published periodically in Kaumudi Magazine. But due to her ill health she left the realm of writing and kept silent till her death. But what she had written in such a short span of time is worth reading. Her characters, especially the women characters are very bold and courageous to face the society. They were never afraid of the insensitive morality imposed by patriarchal society. Instead she tried to prove male world with all its capacities and weaknesses. This novel can be considered a clear cut vision of the society.",
