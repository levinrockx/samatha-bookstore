                    <div class="about-grid-heading">What is Lorem Ipsum</div>
                    <div class="about-grid-contents"> Lorem Ipsum is simply
                        dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                        survived
                        not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                        containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software likeAldus
                        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                        middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks
                        as
                        necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over
                        200
                        Latin words, combined. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
                        Richard
                        McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                        obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
                        word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                        Cicero,
                        written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                        Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
                        section 1.10.32.
